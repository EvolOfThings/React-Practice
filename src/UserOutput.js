      <p>Economists generally think of self interest
        as maximizing the present value of oneâ€™s consumption, 
        or wealth, independent of others. Wealth can be generalized
        to include not just their financial assets, but the 
        present value of their labor income and even public goods.</p>
      <p>Adam Smith emphasized a self-interest that also recognized
        social position and regard for society as a whole,
        but this was well before anyone thought of writing down
        a utility function, which is a mathematically precise
        formulation of how people define their self interest.</p>
